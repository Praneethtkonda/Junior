    A recent report has revealed that a miniscule 0.6% of graduate students are currently working 
    in cyber security. These statistics strengthen the belief held by many industry experts that the 
    cause of the skills gap originates from schools. In order to encourage the youth to participate, 
    they need to be taught at a young age about the importance of cyber security and both its 
    aspects Â­ attack and defence, because if you do not know how to attack, then you will not 
    know what to expect and you do not know how to defend. Several research efforts by 
    computer security experts from across the world suggest that 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security" target="_blank">Capture the Flag style contests</a> 
    are a highly effective method to teach computer security. These contests typically simulate 
    real life scenarios that enable participants to develop real world security skills. Through 
    these contests, students learn how to defend their own systems and the programs on their 
    systems while simultaneously trying to attack and bring down the same of their opponents. 
    Many countries such as the United States of America and China have realized that cyber 
    security preparedness is pivotal for a good position in terms of development on the global 
    stage and have started conducting Capture The Flag contests for high school students to train 
    them from a young age. An example is <a href="https://picoctf.com/" target="_blank">picoCTF</a> 
    hosted exclusively for high school students in USA. This contest is organized by one of the top 
    CTF teams from USA and is supported by several US government organizations such as 
    <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/"  target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a>

    <h1>What is Junior InCTF?</h1>

<div class="well wow fadeInRight">
    <p style="text-align:justify">
    Having realized the dire need for such a training culture in India, 
    <a href="https://www.amrita.edu/" target="_blank">Amrita University</a> is 
    organizing Junior InCTF an online Capture the Flag style contest specifically designed to 
    introduce cyber security awareness and training in high school students. It is a simplified 
    version of <a href="http://inctf.in" target="_blank">InCTF</a>, Indian Capture The Flag, 
    a national level ethical hacking contest that Amrita university hosts every year, for 
    promoting cyber security awareness and training for college students in India. Now with 
    Junior InCTF, we are pushing the boundaries of conventional wisdom by taking up students 
    in 9th, 10th, Plus One and Plus two, and giving them career changing experience and exposure 
    in a field filled with opportunities. Considering the ubiquitous nature of the field and 
    the need for knowledge in cyber security a requirement in just about any profession, the 
    contest will be useful to all students.

<div class="well wow fadeInLeft">
    <p style="text-align:justify">
    <a href="{% static '/register/user' %}" target="_blank">Registration</a> for the contest can

    <a href="http://junior.inctf.in" target="_blank">junior.inctf.in</a> and will be open till 
    1st of November. There will be a set of challenges which 
    the students need to solve during the course of the contest. All the necessary training material 
    required to solve the challenges will also be provided to them. At the end of 2 months, the top 
    performing 40 students will be short listed for a fully sponsored week long workshop aimed at 
    further enhancing their cyber security skills. Attendees will be introduced to fundamental 
    topics of computer security such as 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics" target="_blank">computer forensics</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_security" target="_blank">web application security</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography" target="_blank">cryptography</a> and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Python programming</a>.
    During the course of the workshop, the winners of Junior InCTF will get a variety of 
    prizes such as laptops, tablet computers, mobile phones, 
    <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pis</a> and top computer 
    security books. The university has already conducted 2 editions of the workshop in December 
    2014 and May 2015 and plans to conduct more such workshops for school students in future

<div class="well wow fadeInRight">
    <p style="text-align:justify">
    Developing skills in the area of cyber security opens up a whole new range of career 
    opportunities for skilled graduates. Today graduates with expertise in cyber security are in 
    great demand for the positions of security analysts in top private computer firms in India. Of 
    course apart from the private computer firms the Electronic and Computer Science Division 
    of <a href="http://www.drdo.gov.in/" target="_blank">DRDO</a> 
    (Defence Research and Development Organization) which is the government wing 
    that currently handles the national cyber security, is also in need of individuals with skills, 
    agility and a fresh and updated outlook at cyber security.
